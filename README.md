(App not fully functioning)

## Description

A mobile responsive dynamic web application that allows a user to register by creatiing a username, password, and email address and be stored via PostgresSQL Bcrypt. The user, once created, is able to login in to the site if the user's password is correct. If the password is not correct the user will be redirected to the site Login in page, if the password is correct the user will be redirected to the site dashboard where the user will then be able to choose a category of restaurant. Once a category is chosen a user will then be directed to a restaurant also created in the database in that category to rate and/or comment.
